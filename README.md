# Shiro Class - Classical inheritance in Javascript#

This is a simple implementation of classical style inheritance in javascript, based upon backbone inheritance model and John Resig simple inheritance model. It supports extending basic javascript types like Object, Array, String... In addition it supports automatic attribute linking with the instance object.

It is aimed to be lightweight and independent of big libraries. The only dependicy it requires is **underscore.js**, but it is planned to be removed in future versions.

## Method reference ##

####SomeClass.extend( definition, [classDefinitions])####
Extend is a way to inherit some class with your method definiton passed as an argument to the function. 
The optional parameter classDefinitions adds statis(class) methods on the class itself.
    
#### The ***init*** method ####
The init method in definiton is used to initialize the instance. It ***SHOULD RECIEVE NO ARGUMENTS*** at all,
because the prefered method of passing arugments to to constructor is by sending an object that contains all
the attributes needed for the class that the library automaticly appends. [Why we do this?](#)

### The ***this.__super__*** value ###
The ***this.__super__*** keyword is used to access the parents methods or values, it can come handy when we overwrite some methods in the child class but wan't to access the original value.

####SomeClass.alias( name, listOfAlises )####
    Creates aliases for some class methods, see examples.

## Some Examples ##

Let's create an ***Animal*** class. Each created animal can ***run*** with some ***speed***.
```javascript
var Animal = Object.extend({
    run: function() {
        console.log('running with speed', this.speed, 'km/h' );
    },
    
    speak: function() {
        console.log('i don\'t know how to speak');        
    }
});
```

***Extend*** the ***animal class*** and make a more specific implementation for ***dogs***.
```javascript
// creating a Dog class that extends the class Animal
var Dog = Animal.extend({
    init: function() {
        console.log('creating a new dog named', this.name );
    },
    
    speak: function() {
        console.log('wuf wuf');
    }
});
```

We want to be able to call the ***speak*** action with different names like ***bark*** or ***beFunny***. 
```javascript
// example of aliasing
Dog.alias('speak', ['bark', 'beFunny'] );
```

Create a ***new instance*** of the ***dog*** class and make it do some things.
```javascript
var mike = new Dog({speed: 5, name: 'mike'})

mike.run();   // print out 'running with speed 5 km/h'
mike.speak(); // prints out 'wuf wuf'
mike.bark();  // is the same thing as the above call, prints out 'wuf wuf'
```
